These are basic programs I wrote when I was practicing java. They are based off of what I thought my siblings would find useful.

## Project 2: Scheduler
Overview: This program was written to help my brother better his time management on school days. It takes homework subjects and activity time slots as inputs, then outputs a simple schedule and a quote. It takes the importance of each subject into account when creating the schedule.

To run: `java Ian`

Example:

![user input](https://github.com/eea15/small-java-projects/blob/master/subjects.png?raw=true)
1. User inputs hw subjects


2. User blocks off time for other activities


3. Schedule generated
