These are basic programs I wrote when I was practicing java. They are based off of what I thought my siblings would find useful.

## Project 1: BulletJournal
Overview: This program was written for my sister to also have a digital bullet journal option. Bullet journaling is a popular modern method of organizing tasks and thoughts to increase productivity. Basically, it is a simplified agenda in which each bullet point has a different significance.
The bullet journal program allows for creation of new entries and view of old ones by writing to a player file. So, a new name will create a new file while a returning member will already have their entries stored in a file.

Files: 
* bob.txt example player file
* PlayerJournal.java writes to player file
* BulletJournal.java main program

To run: `java BulletJournal <Name>`

Example:

1. User chooses to view previous journal entry

2. User enters new bullets

## Project 2: Scheduler
Overview: This program was written to help my brother better his time management on school days. It takes homework subjects and activity time slots as inputs, then outputs a simple schedule and a quote. It takes the importance of each subject into account when creating the schedule.

Files:
* Homework.java the homework object
* ScheduleGenerator.java generates a schedule
* Ian.java the main program

To run: `java Ian`

Example:

1. User inputs hw subjects

2. User blocks off time for other activities

3. Schedule generated
